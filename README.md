# Physics-informed machine learning as a kernel method

This project aims at illustrating the results of the paper _PIML as a kernel method_ (Nathan Doumèche, Francis Bach, Gérard Biau, and Claire Boyer). The paper has been published in COLT 2024 and is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07514. In particular, the 1-dimensional kernel is implemented in the Jupyter notebook _kernel_regression.ipynb_.
